the "msbuild" project is located in 
    "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319"

You need to add this to your envionrment variables for it to be available in normal cmd prompt

my prefered way:
    -nevermind, this also requires visual studio developer console
    msbuild project.sln /Flags...
        -example
            msbuild TestProject.sln 
                -no flags given, this is in the cmake basic_project folder

microsoft's documenation way:
    -they want you to open the visual studio developers console
    -type cl main.cpp
        -or add exception handling: cl /EHsc main.cpp
